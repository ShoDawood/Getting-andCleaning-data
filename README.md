Getting and Cleaning data
The data is captured is often captured in various formats and places and it is very important to relates the data presented in different forms in different files and link this data through common keys. It is also required to filter out some data so that the study can be carried out on relelvant data

# Current scope
A set of files were provided which captured training and test data related to six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) carried out by a group of 30 volunteers while wearing a smartphone.

The current project is aimed at reading various data elelments, combining the data, cleaning it and restoring the combined data in a tidy format
